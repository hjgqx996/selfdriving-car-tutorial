## Visual Odometry for Localization in Autonomous Driving

Welcome to the assignment for Module 2: Visual Features - Detection, Description and Matching. In this assignment, you will practice using the material you have learned to estimate an autonomous vehicle trajectory by images taken with a monocular camera set up on the vehicle.

**In this assignment, you will:**

- Extract features from the photographs taken with a camera setup on the vehicle.
- Use the extracted features to find matches between the features in different photographs.
- Use the found matches to estimate the camera motion between subsequent photographs.
- Use the estimated camera motion to build the vehicle trajectory.

For most exercises, you are provided with a suggested outline. You are encouraged to diverge from the outline if you think there is a better, more efficient way to solve a problem.
