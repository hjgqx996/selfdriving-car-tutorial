Hello everyone, and welcome to the visual perception course of the self-driving
car specialization. You've probably noticed
that most major players in the autonomous driving
industry have a camera as their primary sensor in
their vehicle sensor suite. The camera is a rich sensor that captures incredible detail
about the environment around the vehicle but requires
extensive processing to make use of the information that's
available in that image. Throughout this course,
you will get hands on experience on how to
algorithmically manipulate camera images to
extract information, useful, not just for
autonomous driving but for robotic
perception in general. In the first module in
week one of this course, we will provide you
with an overview of important concepts related to cameras and computer vision. This module is only meant as a high level summary of
the basics of computer vision. So, we'll move quickly
through a large number of topics to develop more in-depth
knowledge in this area, have a look at
the computer vision courses also available on Coursera. In this first video,
we will highlight why the camera is a critical sensor
for autonomous driving. We will then briefly introduce the concept of
image formation and present the pinhole camera model
which captures the essential elements
of how a camera works in a simple
and elegant manner. We'll then show you an example of
a historic camera design which used the pinhole
principle to create some of the earliest
images ever recorded. The pinhole model will
form the basis of our discussions in
the next video where we investigate how to
project points from the world into the camera
imaging sensor. Of all the common
self-driving car sensors, the camera is the sensor
that provides the most detailed
appearance information from objects in the environment. Appearance information
is particularly useful for scene understanding tasks such as object detection, segmentation and identification. Appearance information is
what allows us to distinguish between road signs or
traffic lights states, to track turn signals and resolve overlapping vehicles
into separate instances. Because of its high
resolution output, the camera is able to collect and provide orders of magnitude, more information than
other sensors used in self-driving while still
being relatively inexpensive. The combination of high valued
appearance information and low cost make
the camera an essential component of our sensor suite. Let us see how
the camera manages to collect this huge amount
of information. A camera is a passive
external receptive sensor. It uses an imaging sensor
to capture information conveyed by light rays emitted
from objects in the world. This was originally done with
film but nowadays we use rather sophisticated
silicon chips to gather this information. Light is reflected
from every point on an object in all directions, and a portion of these rays travel towards the camera sensor. Look at the car's reflected rays collected by our imaging surface. Do you think we will get
a good representation of the car on the image sensor
from this ray-pattern? Unfortunately, no. Using this basic open
sensor camera design, we will end up with blurry images because our imaging
sensor is collecting light rays from
multiple points on the object at the same
location on the sensor. The solution to our problem is to put a barrier in front of the imaging sensor
with a tiny hole or aperture in its center. The barrier allows
only a small number of light rays to pass
through the aperture, reducing the blurriness
of the image. This model is called
the pinhole camera model and describes the relationship between a point in
the world and it's corresponding projection
on the image plane. The two most important parameters in a pinhole camera model are the distance between
the pinhole and the image plane which we
call the focal length, the focal length
defines the size of the object projected
onto the image and plays an important role
in the camera focus when using lenses to
improve camera performance. The coordinates of
the center of the pinhole, which we call the camera center, these coordinates to
find the location on the imaging sensor that the object projection
will inhabit. Although the pinhole
camera model is very simple, it works surprisingly well for representing the image
creation process. By identifying
the focal length and camera's center for
a specific camera configuration, we can mathematically describe
the location that a ray of light emanating from an object in the world will strike
the image plane. This allows us to form
a measurement model of image formation for use in state estimation
and object detection. A historical example of the pinhole camera model
is the camera obscura, which translates to
dark room camera in English. Historical evidence shows that this form of imaging
was discovered as early as 470 BC in Ancient
China and Greece. It's simple construction with a pinhole aperture in front of an imaging surface makes it
easy to recreate on your own, and is in fact a safe way to watch solar eclipse if
you're so inclined. We've come a long way since the invention of
the camera obscura. Current-day cameras
allow us to collect extremely high resolution data. They can operate in
low-light conditions or at a long range due to the advanced lens optics
that gather a large amount of light and focus it
accurately on the image plane. The resolution and sensitivity of camera sensors
continues to improve, making cameras one of the most ubiquitous sensors on the planet. How many cameras do
you think you own? You'd be surprised if you
stop to count them all. You'll have cameras in
your phones, in your car, on your laptop,
they are literally everywhere and in
every device we own today. These advances are also
extremely beneficial for understanding the environment
around a self-driving car. As we discussed in course one, cameras specifically designed for autonomous vehicles need to work well in a wide range of lighting conditions and
in distances to objects. These properties are
essential to driving safely in all
operating conditions. In this introductory lesson, you've learned the usefulness of the camera as a sensor
for autonomous driving. You also saw the pinhole
camera model in its most basic form, which we'll use
throughout this course to construct algorithms
for visual perception. In the next video, we will describe how an image is formed, a process referred to
as projective geometry, which relates
objects in the world to their projections
on the imaging sensor.
