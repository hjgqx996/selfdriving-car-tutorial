00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.600
The challenges that I've observed
in the industry so far is

2
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.935
it's quite difficult driving
in San Francisco.

3
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.120
There's lots of crowds,

4
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.580
there's lots of heavy fog,

5
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.555
rain for example, and lots
of rolling hills as well.

6
00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:33.990
So, at Zoox, currently we're
able to tackle most of

7
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.160
these difficult situations
in San Francisco,

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
and we're able to drive on

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.150
very busy intersections and
take unprotected left turns

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.560
which are probably one of

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.480
the most challenging situations that

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.360
an autonomous vehicle will
encounter on a day-to-day basis.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
Zoox started with two co-founders,

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.075
Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson.

15
00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:01.220
They decided that they
wanted to think of

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.200
the autonomous problem or

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.450
challenge in a different way
than everyone else was doing.

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.384
Everyone else wants to
put sensors on a car,

19
00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:15.485
and they wanted to build
the car from the ground up.

20
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.420
Our vehicle is bidirectional,

21
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.585
that means they won't have to do
U-turns or a three-point turns.

22
00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.745
Our vehicles won't
have steering wheel,

23
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:25.620
you'll have social seeding,

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.050
that means that riders will
sit facing each other.

25
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.685
In addition, one of

26
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.895
the cool things that we can do
is we have all wheels steering.

27
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:38.645
So, all four of the wheels can steer,

28
00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:40.625
and what that means in

29
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.460
dense urban environments like
San Francisco is that if

30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.425
we have a rider on
the side of the road

31
00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.335
and a very narrow spot between cars,

32
00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:49.490
we can get in there.

33
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.800
Whereas more conventional cars

34
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.465
might not be able to
in that situation.

35
00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:56.325
Because the industry is so new,

36
00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:58.040
we at so many different challenges,

37
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.530
we have to find
so many different ways of

38
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.215
solving problems that we've
never had to solve before.

39
00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:07.970
So, it's great and challenging
in trying to figure

40
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.339
out those innovative solutions

41
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.730
to this such a hard
problem that we have.

42
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.815
Zoox has done a really great job
so far in solving that challenge,

43
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:20.155
and I'm glad I'm part of that.

44
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.790
Zoox is well position
to compete against

45
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.135
the large OEMs that are
currently in the field,

46
00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:30.935
because Zoox was born to solve
the problem of autonomous mobility.

47
00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:35.420
We're designing a vehicle from
the ground up that will tackle

48
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.640
the challenges of delivering a
autonomous ride-sharing experience.

49
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.450
The large OEMs have a lot
of existing infrastructure,

50
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.740
they're encumbered by
the current model of car ownership.

51
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.655
Whereas we as
a small and agile start-up

52
00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:57.360
are able to really execute
on our core vision.
