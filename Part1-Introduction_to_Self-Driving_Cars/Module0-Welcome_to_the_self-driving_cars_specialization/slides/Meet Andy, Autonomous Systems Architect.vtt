Hi, I'm Andy Huang, Autonomous System architect.

2
00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:20.550
So, I got started and robotics way back in high school.

3
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.295
I was one of those first robotics kids who competed in Canada.

4
00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.740
By the time I got to university,

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.260
I helped co-found a robotics team and

6
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.050
my faculty adviser at the time had just come back from

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.865
the US and told us about

8
00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:39.200
this competition going on down there called the Darker Challenge,

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.715
which is one of the really main things that kick-started this whole industry.

10
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.330
From that, we spun some autonomous racing activities which I was involved in,

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.830
and at that point, I was pretty well hooked.

12
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.480
It took a few years to work before coming back to grad school,

13
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.125
at which point, I studied vehicle controls in dynamics.

14
00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.650
Now, here I am.

15
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.140
So, I currently work on the next generation of our self-driving car platform.

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.850
Being a systems-level engineer,

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.540
I get the fun distinction of being able to work across

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.530
a wide variety of teams to bring together a cohesive system.

19
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.450
What that means is, I get to work with

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.740
both our software engineers during perception and motion control software,

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.650
for example, and also our hardware engineers designing our sensors and vehicle platforms.

22
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.880
I happen to think robotics is super fun.

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.670
This problem in particular is one that I really love

24
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.985
because that's a direct impact on the quality of human life.

25
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:42.830
Not only are we striving to improve the safety and save human lives,

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.850
I think it may also have the opportunity to help re-shape how we think about

27
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.770
transportation or even how we use our cities to make life more efficient, more happy.
