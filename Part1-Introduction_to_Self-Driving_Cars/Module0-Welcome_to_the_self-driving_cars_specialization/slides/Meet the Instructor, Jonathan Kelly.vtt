00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.030
My name is Jonathan Kelly,

2
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.620
and I am an assistant professor at

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.070
the Institute for Aerospace Studies at the University of Toronto Canada.

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.630
As a child, I used to love to go every month to the magazine store,

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.815
and I would always read popular mechanics or popular science.

6
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:33.720
They had all these interesting articles about things with space travel,

7
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.235
to new vehicles, to new computing designs,

8
00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:39.540
just really interesting stuff.

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900
So, that's ultimately what prompted me to start looking at

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.220
science and technology as a possible career choice.

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.335
One of the things that happened when I was quite young

12
00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.505
was the first space shuttle disaster, the Challenger disaster.

13
00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:53.690
I can still remember that actually,

14
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.430
and thinking just, my goodness,

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.935
how this that something must have gone wrong,

16
00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:03.590
and just how dire the consequences were this this tremendous explosion.

17
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.050
At the time, I just remember sitting stunned,

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.375
thinking technologies sort of always worked.

19
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.180
That was my opinion. Technology always works.

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.785
It doesn't fail.

21
00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.420
Cars don't just explode.

22
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.990
Then seeing this on television really brought it home

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.495
that engineering really does matter.

24
00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:26.900
Solid engineering is critically important in

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.445
these life-threatening or potentially life-changing situations.

26
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.630
Self-driving cars are in many ways very similar.

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.300
We have a responsibility as engineers to design

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.420
these systems to be as safe and reliable as possible as we can.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.350
It's one of the things that's the most exciting technology revolutions

30
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.375
that's really coming in the near term.

31
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.835
New ideas, new technologies,

32
00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:53.480
new designs are coming down the pipe every single day.

33
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.735
I often to sit down at my desk and my eyes sort of pop,

34
00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.670
when I see the number of

35
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.515
innovative new ideas and techniques that people are coming out with.

36
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:06.395
It's also excitement from a point of view of actually changing

37
00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:09.620
the technology landscape and doing

38
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.890
something that will potentially benefit a lot of people.
