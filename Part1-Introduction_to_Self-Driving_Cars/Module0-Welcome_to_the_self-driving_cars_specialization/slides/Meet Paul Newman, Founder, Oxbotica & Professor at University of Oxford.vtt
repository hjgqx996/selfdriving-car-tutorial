00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:16.174
Hi, I'm Paul Newman.

3
00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:17.911
I'm CTO and founder of Oxbotica, and

4
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.550
Professor of Information Engineering
at the University of Oxford.

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.530
So I can remember the day that I got
interested in self-driving vehicles and

6
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.830
autonomy, and it was actually in Sydney.

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.860
And I was talking to a PhD student,
I'd just started my PhD,

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.740
and he introduced this problem
called the SLAM problem.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.030
So can a vehicle figure out where it is in
the world without having been given a map,

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.340
and can it build a map itself?

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.710
And I knew then that was the mother
of all problems I wanted to work on.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.416
So I can remember, and
it was the 19th of March 1996,

13
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:54.840
I really discovered that
there was a big problem here.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.710
And since then, it's never got old.

15
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.323
We know how to solve those problems now,
but

16
00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:04.335
I was always an engineer
trying to build things.

17
00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.985
And then I discovered that the most
exciting way to build things was

18
00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.984
a combination of software and
mechanical things, and

19
00:01:10.984 --> 00:01:14.460
that's almost by definition robotics,
then I was in heaven.

20
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
So I've never really lost that from
probably about nine, when I started

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
trying to program very basic computers
through to what I do everyday now.

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.540
It's a thrill that's never left me.

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.240
Okay, so what do we do here at Oxbotica?

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.380
Well, we build the software that
makes autonomous vehicles autonomous.

25
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.870
We go from the lowest level sensors
all the way up, through the stack,

26
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.220
through planning,
through localization, through control,

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.810
through perception up to
fleet management systems.

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.320
So the whole software environment that
makes fleets of vehicles autonomous

29
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.950
is what we build and we develop.

30
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.532
Now, down at the university I'm the
Director of the Autorobotics Institute,

31
00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:56.979
I've got great life there too.

32
00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.294
So there I work on what are the hard,
hard problems of autonomy and

33
00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:04.980
robotics that are perhaps
ten years down the line?

34
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.710
What are those really sort of nascent
research questions of machines and

35
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.830
intelligence and

36
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.480
machine learning that we would want in our
vehicles in the five to ten-year period?

37
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300
So I've got a very privileged life.

38
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.380
So why do I care about
self-driving cars so much?

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.719
Because transport's dumb,
it's broken at the moment.

40
00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.750
80% of all accidents in the road
are caused by inattention.

41
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.520
The one thing that machines
won't do is get bored.

42
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.461
So we don't deal with that in any way.

43
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.515
The way in which we drive is inefficient.

44
00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:41.237
As we get older, as we get more infirm,

45
00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:45.376
the one thing we need is to stay
in contact with our species.

46
00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:49.130
And if we say, yes, I'm sorry,
you're eyesight's fading, can't drive.

47
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.730
If you had an epileptic fit,
you can't drive.

48
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.210
So the whole edifice of how we
drive ourselves and move our atoms,

49
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.220
be they human atoms or
goods atoms, is just nuts.

50
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.700
It's derived from horses and carts.

51
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.320
We wouldn't do that if we had our
technology now, so that's nuts.

52
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.082
And software and
algorithms are going to change that.

53
00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:14.996
I'm absolutely sure that we'll
have more atoms move better and

54
00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:17.734
safer, because of AV technology.

55
00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:22.838
So there's a question about
should the vehicles themselves be

56
00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:28.528
independently smart or
should they leverage smart infrastructure?

57
00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:30.173
So what's smart infrastructure?

58
00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:34.390
A traffic light that says, I'm about
to turn red, and this is my location.

59
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.152
Or a roundabout, a rotary, that says,

60
00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:41.068
this is where the vehicles are,
your slot's coming up.

61
00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:45.590
There's any number of ways we could
think about instrumenting our cities.

62
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.881
So my view is that the vehicles
themselves need to be smart

63
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:56.187
enough to deal without
a dependency on infrastructure.

64
00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:58.754
And if smart infrastructure is provided,

65
00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:01.614
then sure, you can use it,
if you can trust it.

66
00:04:01.614 --> 00:04:05.856
And there's questions about cybersecurity,
and that's throughout the whole stack,

67
00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.789
really, the cybersecurity question.

68
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.250
So my view is the vehicle itself
must be smart enough to deal,

69
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.444
just like you are as a driver.

70
00:04:14.444 --> 00:04:19.021
You can look at traffic lights and you can
look at lane boundaries, and you don't

71
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:23.420
need to be told by the car in front that
there's a car in front, you can see it.

72
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.780
Because if that
infrastructure is taken away,

73
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.890
you still want to be able to
have an autonomous vehicle.

74
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.328
It could be augmented by infrastructure,
but

75
00:04:32.328 --> 00:04:34.709
I believe you shouldn't
be dependent on it.

76
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.559
because if you solve that problem,

77
00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.550
then you really do have all of
transport in any place in grasp.

78
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.870
Might take some time, but
you're in that trajectory.

79
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.260
And you're not dependent on
expensive bespoken infrastructure.

80
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.585
And my view of expensive,
bespoke infrastructure for

81
00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:54.506
self-driving cars is called city.

82
00:04:54.506 --> 00:05:02.270
