00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.625
Is this a worthy field to get involved in?

2
00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:22.575
Well, I think the moral, the safety,

3
00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:26.490
the efficiency, transporting more atoms better,

4
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890
safer, quicker for us,

5
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.435
that's a compelling argument in itself.

6
00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.510
But on my word, is it interesting?

7
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.600
It's a hard problem to be working

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.460
and it's not a problem that we're just going to go, "Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.045
Do you remember that Wednesday? That was the day we figured that out."

10
00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.055
Or any day, nothing special about Wednesdays.

11
00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:46.865
So, it's a real exciting career

12
00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.330
to be in because we're at the start of it and it's not going to finish anytime soon,

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.800
and the problems are really,

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.210
really hard and diverse.

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.470
So, if you're an engineer and you go,

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.360
"I really like to work on hard problems that aren't obvious,

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.150
but as I crack in,

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.660
as I a peel this onion,

19
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.270
I'm going to have a big impact on how things are moved."

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.620
Then, you should totally do this course and you should totally become an AV engineer.

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.410
I think this course should be very important to take because it will teach

22
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.800
you a lot of the fundamentals of the self-driving car space.

23
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.470
It'll teach you a wide range of topics.

24
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.960
It'll teach you a lot of what you need to know in order to

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.470
understand and develop the systems going forward.

26
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.880
It'll make you a flexible,

27
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.320
knowledgeable engineer who's going to be

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.520
able to adapt to this really fast-paced industry.

29
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.780
I think that the course or courses are very

30
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.420
useful for anyone trying to get into this industry as they give you a better,

31
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.360
more general view of everything that goes on,

32
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.695
and goes into making a vehicle drive by itself.

33
00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:53.375
It would be very useful to try and get into that space using that.

34
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.510
I've actually used part of what I

35
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.170
learned in my controls courses in University of Waterloo,

36
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.095
which is part of these courses as well.

37
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:06.245
I've used PID controllers in robotics.

38
00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:10.390
So, all of this is even useful from a firmware standpoint.

39
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.300
One way for individuals already out there in the work space to break into

40
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.265
the self-driving field is to gain some knowledge

41
00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:19.820
about some of the problems that we're facing.

42
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.590
For example, state estimation.

43
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.380
One of the ways to learn that would be to take this Coursera course.
