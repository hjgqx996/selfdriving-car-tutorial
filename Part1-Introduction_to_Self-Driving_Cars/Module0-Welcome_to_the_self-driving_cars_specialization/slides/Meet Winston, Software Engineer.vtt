00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.960
My name is Winston Yu.

2
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.305
I'm currently a software engineer and localization and mapping at Zoox.

3
00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:24.240
So, how I got started in autonomous vehicles

4
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.255
is when I was in my final year of university.

5
00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:31.290
General Motors and the Society of Automotive Engineers or SAE,

6
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.555
they got together and they created the student competition called auto drive.

7
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:41.170
This was basically a three-year competition and at the end of each year,

8
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.675
there would be a contest.

9
00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:47.240
The goal was at the end of all three years,

10
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.980
for the student teams to be able to create a level four vehicle,

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.175
level four on the SAE autonomy scale.

12
00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:01.220
I was leading the trajectory planning team and I designed

13
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.770
the trajectory planning and lane

14
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.250
changing algorithms that we used in the contest in first year.

15
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.970
So, what end up happens we ended up winning.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.510
We won first place and we've submitted

17
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.595
a paper detailing our design and that's in progress right now.

18
00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.860
So, the moment I realized I was interested in

19
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.005
self-driving cars and this is a bit of a story, is way back.

20
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.235
At the beginning of my university career,

21
00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.770
I was on the UAV student team,

22
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.020
that's Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

23
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.910
So, we were building these fixed-wing drones that were semi-autonomous,

24
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.589
they were remote controlled,

25
00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:45.720
and they had industrial cameras,

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.550
and they had computer onboard.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.040
I led the computer vision side of things for that,

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.850
so I was responsible for detecting these letters painted onto wind signs.

29
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.525
These wind signs would be on the ground and our plane would be up 200 feet in the air.

30
00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:05.060
Then, as I was driving down the street one day I thought, "Well, hey,

31
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.450
can I apply these same computer vision tools that I'm using

32
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.495
to detect the signs to detect road signs?"

33
00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:16.875
I had this idea I was going put webcams on

34
00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:21.890
my parent's car and drive it around the neighborhood and detect all of the street signs.

35
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.040
Well, my parents weren't too thrilled with that.

36
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.555
So, that project didn't end up going anywhere,

37
00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:31.945
but then when the auto drive team at my school started recruiting,

38
00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:35.020
I thought, "Well, hey, this is cool."

39
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.420
Then, once I actually started working on the project,

40
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.080
I realized this is something that I want to do,

41
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.625
and now I'm here.

42
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.565
So, at Zoox, I'm on the CLAMS team,

43
00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.260
clams like the shellfish,

44
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.210
and that stands for Calibration,

45
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.190
Localization, and Mapping, simultaneously.

46
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.760
I'm mostly working on the mapping side of things which mostly entails generating 3D maps.

47
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.310
I can't get into too much more detail than that,

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.890
but suffice it to say that right now,

49
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.570
I know more about San Francisco geography

50
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.960
from building our maps than from actually being there.

51
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.310
What really gets me pumped up to go to work in

52
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.730
the mornings is the fact that I'm working on these really,

53
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.490
really cool problems that are cutting edge.

54
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.705
This is things that people or companies really haven't

55
00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:26.550
tackled before because it's still a very active area of development.
