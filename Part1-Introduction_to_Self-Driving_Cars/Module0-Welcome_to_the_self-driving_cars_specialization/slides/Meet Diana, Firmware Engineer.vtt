00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:16.238
I am Diana Burgess, and

3
00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:21.790
I currently work at Zoox on the firmware
team as a firmware engineer.

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.860
A brief background about me.

5
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.300
I have a bachelor's of mechatronics
engineering from the University of

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.550
Waterloo, where I've gone
through a lot of internships and

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.070
worked in a lot of different jobs.

8
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.410
Most recently,
I've worked at, before Zoox,

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.850
I worked at Peloton Technology,
which does semi-autonomous trucks.

10
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.540
I actually got that job because I
had done a internship with Bendix,

11
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.650
which does brakes for trucks.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.451
So I got into autonomous through a bit
of a roundabout way going through

13
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.940
the trucking industry before
going to full autonomy with Zoox.

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.320
I got interested in robotics from
an early age in high school.

15
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.600
So I'd always been interested
in engineering in general and

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
had thought I would do mechanical
engineering in university.

17
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.350
But in high school,
I took some computer courses and

18
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.660
learned I liked programming as well, so
I thought mechatronics was a good idea.

19
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.500
I'd also joined a robotics team,
our first robotics team.

20
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.120
On that you get to build
a complex robot to

21
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.710
compete in a game that changes every year.

22
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.100
So you have to build a whole new robot
to compete in the next year's game.

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.990
And each game has both an autonomous
component and a driver-operated component,

24
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.420
so you have a lot more complex
things to do for that.

25
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.190
So I got really interested in robotics
through those experiences and

26
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.530
it just kind of solidified
through university.

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.630
I currently work on the firmware team.

28
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.490
A lot of my job entails working on
one of the main motion control units,

29
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850
which, in the vehicle,

30
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.520
helps to work with each other part of
the vehicle to control it to, say,

31
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.930
move the brakes, or move the robot in
general in any direction, steer it.

32
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.340
And so a lot of my job is making sure
that we can actually have drivers so

33
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.155
that you can communicate safely
with those other systems.

34
00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:30.104
I also get to, through that,
do a lot of testing and

35
00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:34.908
work with our setup called LapBot,
which is basically a hardware-in-the-loop

36
00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:39.298
tester where you actually get to test
your code on the real hardware before it

37
00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:42.616
goes on to a vehicle that would
drive in any kind of track.

38
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:52.616
