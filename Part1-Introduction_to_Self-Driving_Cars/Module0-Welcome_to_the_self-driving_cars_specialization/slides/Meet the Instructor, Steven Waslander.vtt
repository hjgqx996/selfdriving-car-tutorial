2
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.340
I was a generalist as a kid.

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.630
I loved all kinds of stuff.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.250
I thought I could be a scientist,
I thought maybe a physicist,

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.200
maybe a chemist, no idea really.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.390
I really was clueless as I grew up.

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.780
I was a heavy athlete, I loved doing
cross country skiing and mountain biking,

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.030
these were the things I spent my time on.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.520
I didn't worry about the future.

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.390
I had an idyllic childhood.

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.290
And then you turn 16, or 17,
or 18, and you start to think,

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.700
I gotta do something fun with my life.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.110
And that's where I started
picking up these challenges and

14
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.400
realizing what it was
that kept driving me.

15
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.250
I loved solving math problems,
I loved doing chemistry, or

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.840
doing calculus challenges
with my friends after school.

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.150
This is the kind of stuff I did,
just on the side, with no real focus.

18
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.330
So it wasn't until I really started to try
to pick something to do that I found these

19
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.980
specific applications with the things I
like doing, actually come up all the time.

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.562
So as I graduated from university,
I actually took a job at Pratt &

21
00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:10.745
Whitney Canada, which is one of our small
jet engine manufacturing companies.

22
00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.554
While I worked at Pratt & Whitney,
it was fascinating,

23
00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:16.195
we got to do things like test
out jet engine controls.

24
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:20.966
And so I had all this fun exposure to
aeronautics, but the challenging part

25
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:25.983
about aeronautics is that there's
an extremely strong safety requirement.

26
00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:28.523
And so everything you do has
to be buttoned down, and

27
00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:31.060
has to work precisely
every time you do it.

28
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.717
And so the development in that area really
is dictated by 30 year old technology

29
00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:38.537
that's been vetted over,
and over, and over.

30
00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:40.052
And so that was really frustrating for me,

31
00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:43.330
as a young engineer trying to get things
moving and trying to change the world.

32
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.050
So I took those wonderful experiences
from the aerospace industry, and

33
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.175
that focus on safety, and
I turned it into a graduate career,

34
00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:56.500
where I entered the aeronautics and
astronautics, and started building drones.

35
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.630
Yeah, it's problem solving,
itâ€™s algorithm development.

36
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.630
It's taking a robot task, something like
landing a drone on a moving car, or trying

37
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.870
to get a self driving car to park itself
or navigate through an obstacle field.

38
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.820
All of these problems are really
practical, really applied, and

39
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.490
you can really see the results
of them as you're building,

40
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.310
you can see how well it's working.

41
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.410
If the drone misses the car,
it crashes and

42
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.390
fails, there is sort of an exciting
aspect to that that's really fun, right?

43
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.650
So to make a self-driving car, you have
to first start by turning a regular

44
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.200
automobile into a drive-by-wire vehicle.

45
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.690
This means that you can plug a computer
into the car and send commands to the gas,

46
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.640
steering, and brakes, and the car will
actually execute those maneuvers.

47
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.690
Once you've got that capability,

48
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.660
you can literally start to program
it to do whatever you want.

49
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.030
From there, you have to add
a whole suite of sensors, and

50
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.160
the computation in the trunk,

51
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.850
and with all these pieces you can start to
built up your own self-driving vehicle.

52
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.370
So my research lab is built around
the idea that if we have a real test bed,

53
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.042
and we put it in a real situations,

54
00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.824
we'll learn a lot more quickly what
the limitations are in current methods.

55
00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:03.787
What we're looking at, really, is finding
research problems that are particularly

56
00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:05.425
suited to the academic community.

57
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:09.949
So we're looking at those problems like
dealing with adverse weather conditions,

58
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.346
or dealing with some of these edge cases,
or trying to theoretically demonstrate

59
00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:19.145
that the methods we're using have
a safety aspect that we can quantify.

60
00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:23.165
So there's really lots of specific
problems that we can work on in academia,

61
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.540
we can try a bunch of crazy ideas.

62
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.780
We can explore this space of possible
solutions a little bit faster than,

63
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.530
or maybe a little less guided,
than you might do in industry.

64
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.690
Definitely going to see increased
performance from these vehicles.

65
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.070
We're going to see things like the Tesla
autopilot just getting better and

66
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.350
better every year.

67
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.610
And we're going to see fleets of
vehicles that really are autonomous,

68
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.700
working in restricted domains where
they know they're safe to operate.

69
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.460
But I still think that we have a lot
of work to do to get that final

70
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.342
full autonomy anywhere you
want to drive it level.

71
00:03:55.342 --> 00:03:58.900
This is just because there's so many
different ways that the cars can fail.

72
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.930
There's so many different situations
that they have to understand.

73
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.958
So many strange conditions that you
just can't predict ahead of time.

74
00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.800
So, if you're new to self driving, and
you think this is a wonderful area, and

75
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.530
you want to try it, I think the first
thing you want to do, obviously,

76
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.980
is follow this Coursera specialization.

77
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.785
But from there, there's hundreds of ways
that you can enrich your knowledge, and

78
00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:21.435
get a better sense of how
to get into this area.

79
00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:27.375
This whole field depends on the
fundamentals of robotics, the fundamentals

80
00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:33.000
of computer vision, the fundamentals
of neural networks and deep learning.

81
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.810
And these are areas that
you can study extensively.

82
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.110
And what's really fun about those is
they also apply to other wonderful

83
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.320
applications.

84
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.590
So think robot manipulators,
think cell phone camera systems, and

85
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.340
improved features for taking videos,
drone flights, and tracking of objects.

86
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.790
There's tons of things you
can do with this stuff.

87
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.540
And for
those of you thinking about whether or

88
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.030
not self driving is a direction to go
in and is a good avenue to explore,

89
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.328
it's absolutely clear that this
market is just going to keep growing.

90
00:05:04.328 --> 00:05:06.940
There's just an insatiable demand for

91
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.270
the students that are coming
out of our programs.

92
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.500
It's pretty amazing, yeah.

93
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.970
It's been a long time since I played with
random math problems after school, right?

94
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.310
And so to think that I'm now
working on self driving cars, and

95
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.854
I've been playing with drones for
years, I'm just a lucky guy.

96
00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:32.854
