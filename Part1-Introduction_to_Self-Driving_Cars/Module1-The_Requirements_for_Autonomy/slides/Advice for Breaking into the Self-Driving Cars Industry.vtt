00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.130
Some advice for junior people

2
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.160
trying to break into
the autonomous industry,

3
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.340
getting a degree in
engineering definitely helped

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.380
me especially from
the University of Waterloo

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.150
where I got to do
a lot of internships,

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.040
a lot of interactive projects,

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.150
and I also during that time helped
mentor FIRST Robotics team.

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.730
So, all of that helped
to boost up my resume.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.714
So, if you wanted to get into

10
00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:40.565
the autonomous space into
firmware engineering,

11
00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.515
some of the schooling
that you might want

12
00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:44.795
is an engineering degree.

13
00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.120
You can also do it
through a CS degree,

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.665
but getting some real experience
with hardware definitely helps.

15
00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.220
In my final of university,

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.800
I took embedded classes to get
more familiar with more of

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.110
the low level software or

18
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.880
the low level aspects of

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.350
software that I would need
in a more day-to-day life.

20
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.200
Being very familiar with
the hardware definitely helps in

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.120
my day-to-day job because
I'm actuating pieces.

22
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.890
We've definitely have seen people in

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.030
this industry who have more of

24
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.505
a mechanical background
and that also helps,

25
00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:26.750
but just knowing how to code
also definitely helps with

26
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.730
that and knowing all of

27
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.880
the pieces around you,
robotics in general,

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.705
I think that mechatronics
engineering was

29
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.750
definitely a help for that
for me because it was so

30
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.385
well-rounded and I got to do

31
00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.295
everything and there
were so many projects

32
00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.320
that definitely helped me

33
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.380
to figure out how
everything went together.

34
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.630
So, I think in the
industry right now,

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.165
because it's growing so
fast and so rapidly,

36
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:55.515
pretty much every role is
needed including firmware or

37
00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.580
even perception or any part

38
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.370
of the autonomous stack
just needs people.

39
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.665
I get contacted specifically a lot

40
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.065
about firmware jobs because
of my background in firmware,

41
00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.050
but I think that in general,

42
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.210
there are just so many jobs out there

43
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.595
right now that everyone's
just trying to

44
00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:18.875
get the best people to work on
their autonomous challenge.

45
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.955
It's a very aggressively
hiring industry,

46
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.970
so I constantly get recruited by

47
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.555
other companies looking
to just get people and

48
00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:33.005
I'm obviously trying to find
as many people as possible

49
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:37.460
for ZOOX so that we can
continue working and growing.

50
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.120
It seems like we're doing pretty
good considering our numbers,

51
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
but as always there's always more
people needed and everybody's

52
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.480
trying to solve this problem
and everyone's trying to

53
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.120
get all the best people
to work on it.

54
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.850
Now that I've had the chance
to work in industry,

55
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.550
I think the ideal candidate
would be people who

56
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.280
are interested and
excited about the field.

57
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.455
In terms of technical skills,

58
00:03:01.455 --> 00:03:03.905
are fluent in C++ and Python.

59
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:07.820
We need research engineers who
are able to solve problems from

60
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.380
first principles and we also

61
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.750
need people with
machine learning experience.

62
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.810
One of the biggest pieces
of advice I can give to

63
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.820
people at the undergraduate
or graduate level

64
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.355
is to join student teams.

65
00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:20.179
Student teams gives
you the opportunity

66
00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.650
to work collaboratively with

67
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.070
your peers and develop your
communication leadership skills.

68
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.950
Although, the projects you work
on might not be cutting edge,

69
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.750
at the same time they
really help you gain

70
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.465
experience working in
a semi-professional setting.

71
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:36.110
Communication skills are
important for people out in

72
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.430
the workplace as well because
especially in autonomous driving,

73
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.580
we have all of these unique problems
that we need to solve

74
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.650
and being able to

75
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.500
communicate your ideas
clearly is vitally important.

76
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.360
Being there when things fail

77
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.095
is a very valuable
learning experience.

78
00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:55.340
A lot of the skills carry over.

79
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.160
For example, troubleshooting,
working with others,

80
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.870
being able to solve problems,

81
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.340
I found that experience very

82
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.610
helpful once I started
working in the industry.

83
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.440
My advice for junior engineers
looking to break into

84
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.950
the industry is really to
be hands-on and practical,

85
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.785
to try taking on projects yourself.

86
00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.375
That could take the form of

87
00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:17.735
either a laptop on wheels where
you program your own stack into

88
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:20.315
end or using the simulator to

89
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:21.740
predict what the environment would be

90
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.495
like once we do hit the ground.

91
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:27.125
I think solving
these practical problems

92
00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.960
through practical means
with teach you

93
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.460
a lot and I personally
have drawn a lot

94
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.840
from previous projects in
my day-to-day job nowadays.

95
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.500
What advice would I
gave if you wanted to

96
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.050
come and work in an NAV company?

97
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.380
Well, first of all, be open
to all areas of engineering.

98
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.130
Don't become just a computer
vision specialist if you can.

99
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.000
Try and understand that this is
fundamentally a robotics question,

100
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.030
because we have software
using multiple sensors,

101
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.120
trying to ask some very difficult
questions in the presence of

102
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.630
a very devious world that's
got strange lighting,

103
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.585
strange weather, people
behaving in strange ways.

104
00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:04.280
You have to know a bit
about control or

105
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.599
interfacing to people
who know about control,

106
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.640
who know about planning,
who know about vision,

107
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.795
who know about lasers, who
know about communications,

108
00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:12.440
who know about systems engineering.

109
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.970
You're going to want
to be interacting

110
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.260
with those individuals
the whole time.

111
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.450
So, I would say, understand this as

112
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.355
a big engineering science problem.

113
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.110
Obviously code.

114
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.480
Like code all the time.

115
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.205
Practice, practice, practice
and code well. Be proud.

116
00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:32.000
If you have a circuit
as an undergraduate

117
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.870
and you building a circuit
and if it looks shocking,

118
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.795
it probably is shocking.

119
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.840
That's a good joke with electricity,

120
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.790
but the same is true for software.

121
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.280
So, be a proud software
engineer about

122
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.375
the quality of the code that you're
writing and you will do well.

123
00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:50.815
Love getting into
the mess of it, right?

124
00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.100
Please don't work
with cameras indoors,

125
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.470
go out into a rainstorm,
go into the snow,

126
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.290
go into the blinding sun and
go with cameras out there,

127
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.780
and don't worry if it doesn't work,

128
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.650
because that's the best
lesson you could get.

129
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.490
So, boldly go out
into places that are

130
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.345
tricky for these systems to
work in and learn from that.

131
00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:12.320
Be a proud roboticist and be
a systems engineer as well,

132
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.075
because it's a full-stack
problem, right?

133
00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:17.480
It's not just I want to
process a camera really well,

134
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.830
I want two spot cars,

135
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.130
it's all of it and it all
has to interact in the end.
