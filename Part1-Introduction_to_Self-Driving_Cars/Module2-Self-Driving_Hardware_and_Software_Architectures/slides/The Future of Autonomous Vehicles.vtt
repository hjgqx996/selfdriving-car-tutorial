1
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.745
How do I see the world of
autonomous vehicles evolving?

2
00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:23.295
Well, it's not I think an industry
where suddenly you nailed it.

3
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.740
It's like an analog computers.

4
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.000
We haven't finished computers.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.945
No one says when will
we have computers?

6
00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:32.525
It's not done.

7
00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:34.220
It's something that gets better

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.350
over time just like
computing and software.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.850
This is a big endeavor and it

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.655
starts now, and it's
never going to stop.

11
00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:42.300
So, every year they're
going to be getting better,

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.990
they're going to get smarter.

13
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.250
I think it's an interesting play
because this time it's software,

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.320
not the arrangement of
steel atoms that makes the play.

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.330
That makes the difference. There's
something extraordinary about

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.710
the way that software is

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.555
so non-linear, and
the impact they can have.

18
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.300
It doesn't cost much to copy
software but it does cost

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.770
a final amount to make

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.530
another imprint of a car
that costs something.

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.825
So, something quite extraordinary
there that's coming through.

22
00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.195
So, it's a great space to
be working in because you

23
00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:16.780
can write software that
doesn't require a steel plant,

24
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.910
and you can have
an impact on transport.

25
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.170
I think that's absolutely
remarkable haven't

26
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.385
really seen that before.

27
00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.710
You had to own an oil and gas field,

28
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380
or a car factory,

29
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.050
and all the rest of it to
make an impact in transport

30
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.390
before and now it's because
you can write text files,

31
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.255
and that's something
quite extraordinary.

32
00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:40.475
The industry is very new but
the future is very bright.

33
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.655
As for how will Zoox compete

34
00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:45.830
with the automotive OEMs

35
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.110
that are already out
there working on this.

36
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.430
I think that Zoox is
unique in its approach,

37
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.885
and I think that solving

38
00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.154
the self-driving vehicle challenge

39
00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:59.890
isn't just an automotive challenge.

40
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.110
By removing the human,

41
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.150
you have to build in
so much extra redundancy and you

42
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.210
have to have so much extra software
to make that work that you

43
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.545
have to both look at

44
00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:15.630
the automotive engineering as
well as looking at Aerospace,

45
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.465
and computer science, and
software engineering.

46
00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:21.710
So, Zoox is really set up for that
because it was born to do that.

47
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.760
It was born to build
the vehicle from the ground up,

48
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.430
and it had that mission
the entire time.

49
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.930
It's very focused on that mission,

50
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.570
and so it's less encumbered by
what some of the larger OEMs would

51
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.105
have especially since
they've starting

52
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:41.480
mostly with just
automotive engineering.

53
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.560
I see the self-driving industry
really taking off because there's

54
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.015
this convergence of two things,
Autonomy and ride-sharing.

55
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:55.020
So right now cars are utilized
maybe five percent of

56
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.420
the time so that means that

57
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.315
95 percent of the time they're
sitting in your driveway,

58
00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:02.680
they're sitting in
a parking lot at work.

59
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.290
The beauty of self-driving
is that we're

60
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.770
able to take these
autonomous vehicles,

61
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.935
and have them out on the road
for the majority of the day,

62
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:17.775
and to be able to move
more riders with less vehicles.

63
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:19.920
I could see the industry going

64
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.110
two ways in terms of
personal ownership,

65
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.430
or transportation as a service.

66
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.690
I see arguments for both and perhaps

67
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.260
the reality is in the future
we'll see a combination of both.

68
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.160
I could see people always
wanting to own their own vehicle

69
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.000
for luxury or privacy reasons,

70
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.310
and also accessible transportation

71
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.740
would benefit greatly from
autonomous technology.

72
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110
So, it's very likely that
we'll see both on the horizon.

73
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.160
A question that often
comes up around AVs

74
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.170
is when will I be able to buy one?

75
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.510
It's a very reasonable question.

76
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.860
I think we will first experience
them by not buying one,

77
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.720
but by getting a ride in one in
certain areas in certain cities.

78
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.065
So, that's the Geofencing argument.

79
00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:09.805
The vehicles will first appear

80
00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:12.190
working in an area of
a city that they're

81
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.110
well rehearsed and
well-practiced and you know

82
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.509
a lot about how that city changes,

83
00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.890
and it's lighting conditions,

84
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.240
and when it gets busy,

85
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.670
and where the really
hard turnings are,

86
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.885
and they'll be like fancy buses,

87
00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.305
our transport service in a city.

88
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:29.705
But the question that actually
people want me to answer is,

89
00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:33.820
when will I be able
to walk into vocal of

90
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.300
a car sales room and say I'll

91
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.800
have the one with
no steering wheel, and no windows?

92
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.820
Which is basically what
our full L5 system would be like.

93
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.350
No human is needed ever and the
vehicle can go wherever, whenever,

94
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.785
whatever the weather, anywhere,

95
00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:55.580
and you never have to worry
about not getting there.

96
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.960
So, it has the same functionality
that your car does now,

97
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.235
and it's a consumer piece of tech.

98
00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.530
That's a long way off.

99
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.040
Because the complexity
of driving many of

100
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.350
the difficult situations
have got nothing to

101
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.810
do with your driving test at all.

102
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.800
You solve this random problem.

103
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.980
That's because you're a human,

104
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.715
you go, I know what to do there.

105
00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:22.445
It might be the only time ever
driving that problem ever arises,

106
00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:23.995
and you solve it in that way.

107
00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:26.205
You actually reverse
around it and go,

108
00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:27.770
it's a plastic bag and
it's going to drive

109
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.210
over that coupled boxes.

110
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.845
I think it really is
just car boredom,

111
00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.690
or there's some cows on
the road and I'm going to

112
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.705
wait for them to pass because
they're going to pass it.

113
00:05:34.705 --> 00:05:36.285
Any number of things.

114
00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.030
Those are really hard problems

115
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.950
or dealing with the twos
and blues coming up behind,

116
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.060
and pulling off up onto
the sidewalk because you

117
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.620
know that the person has also

118
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.570
clocked that there's
a siren coming behind.

119
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.770
So, they're not going to
be alarmed that you're

120
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.455
driving at them on the sidewalk,

121
00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:53.625
and there's some social contract
between the two of you.

122
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:57.080
I could go on with
all the interesting corner cases

123
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.450
that we as humans solve,

124
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.204
but to have a vehicle

125
00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:05.330
that it's a five sigma takes
you from wherever you are,

126
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.605
to wherever you want to go,

127
00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:09.380
anytime a day,
any weather, any country,

128
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.140
anywhere, and you have
the same confidence

129
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.125
you do in the vehicle you buy
now, then you can do that.

130
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.500
That's a long way away,
and that's great.

131
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.720
That's like saying when do we
have the best computers ever?

132
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.340
Well, it just gets better every day.

133
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.990
You can't answer that question.

134
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.610
But that doesn't mean that we don't

135
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.310
transform transport before that.

136
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.470
Yeah. So, cars didn't
go everywhere to

137
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.170
start with, but they've
got better and better.
