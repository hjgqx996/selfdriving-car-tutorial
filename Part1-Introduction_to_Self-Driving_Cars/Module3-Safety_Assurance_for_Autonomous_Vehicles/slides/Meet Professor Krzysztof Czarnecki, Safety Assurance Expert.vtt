Hi everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.575
the self-driving car garage at
the University of Waterloo.

3
00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:23.130
I'm here with my good friend and
colleague, Krzysztof Czarnecki.

4
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.720
We're going to talk today about

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.845
safety aspects of autonomous driving.

6
00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:28.535
Why don't we start a little bit with

7
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:29.750
all the great things you've done

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.645
in terms of safety designed
for autonomous vehicles?

9
00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.540
I've worked for DIMER Research.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.755
That's been 16 years ago
and 12 years ago,

11
00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:44.850
I had a chance to ride in
a autonomous vehicle, a prototype.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.600
One of the early ones.

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360
Oh, yeah, it was pretty exciting.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.950
When I arrived in Waterloo,

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.260
I've worked on automotive
software and safety has

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.720
been always an important topic
in automotive software,

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.425
mostly in terms of potential bugs.

18
00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:57.990
Essentially, you don't
want to get the debts

19
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.540
of the screen of death.

20
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.570
Essentially, in
a vehicle while you are

21
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.985
driving at 100 kilometers an hour,

22
00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:08.540
the auto burn, and for
about two years now,

23
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.660
I've been working on autonomous
vehicles and particularly,

24
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.140
the safety aspect of it.

25
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.325
So, focusing on architecture,
the design methodologies,

26
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.885
dealing with safety
of machine learning

27
00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:25.060
and the behavior of
the vehicle in traffic.
