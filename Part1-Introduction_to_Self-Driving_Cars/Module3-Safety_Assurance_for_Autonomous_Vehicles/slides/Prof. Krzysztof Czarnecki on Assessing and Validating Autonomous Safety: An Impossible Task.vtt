2
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:18.712
What do you think are the challenging
questions that we need to answer,

3
00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:21.720
in terms of defining safety for
an autonomous car?

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.780
Is it a solved problem, do we know how to
assess safety in self-driving vehicles?

5
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.090
Or are there just too many things or too
many variables to actually properly handle

6
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.220
a concrete definition of whether or
not a car is safe?

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.700
>> So safety can be defined
easily in terms of language.

8
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.800
You can basically say,

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.060
well, it's a absence of unreasonable risk,
in this case, risk of a crash.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.800
However, when you dig down into
the definition, it becomes very complex,

11
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.700
because essentially,
the question is what is unreasonable risk?

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.510
And then how do you show that that
unreasonable risk is not there, right,

13
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.405
that basically you only
have acceptable risk?

14
00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:02.328
>> Right.

15
00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.815
>> And with any complex system,

16
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:09.996
you have to essentially identify
the hazards that are there.

17
00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:10.853
>> Yeah.

18
00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:15.041
>> And essentially,
these hazards can exist in the design,

19
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:20.190
in the implementation, but
also in the operation of a system, right?

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.570
So essentially, we have three steps.

21
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.000
We have to identify these hazards,
we have to identify the mechanisms or

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.030
the ways in which the hazards can occur,
and then we have to address them.

23
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.083
Right, we have to address them in design,
implementation, and operation.

24
00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:40.130
And so for self-driving vehicles, there's
many of these hazards that can occur.

25
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.050
>> For sure, and so

26
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.200
it seems like the challenge is a bit
about how much testing has to be done.

27
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.513
There's a Rand report that came
out that expressed the numbers.

28
00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:53.269
It's just absolutely astronomical to
guarantee that we understand whether or

29
00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.680
not we're achieving
human-level performance,

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.450
something on the order of 400 years
of testing, 24 hours, 7 days a week.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.450
Do you see that as a fundamental stopper?

32
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.050
Is this whole pursuit of
autonomous driving just

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.480
impossible because of the requirements for
testing, or

34
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.600
is there some way around this
astronomical number of miles?

35
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.878
>> So I don't think there's a way
around having enough of these miles.

36
00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:22.969
Before it was called validation testing,
so

37
00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.631
essentially understanding
the requirements, right?

38
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:26.280
>> Right.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.855
>> And even though these are sort
of astronomical numbers, once

40
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:34.860
you have a large enough fleet, we will
eventually collect these miles, right?

41
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.910
>> So we have to release the technology
before we know whether or

42
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.420
not it's reliable?

43
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.220
>> Of course, we have to do
this in an incremental fashion.

44
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.750
That's why we do the testing, initially.

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.820
It's a feedback loop.

46
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.810
We learn about what works in practice,
what are the risks, and

47
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.900
we address those risks as we roll out.

48
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.634
So there's a very important distinction
between the validation testing and

49
00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:03.146
verification testing, where,
let's say if you change your system, or

50
00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:08.424
let's say you improve your software, you
don't have to redo all these kilometers.

51
00:03:08.424 --> 00:03:11.478
The kilometers are there,
defined in the requirements, but

52
00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:13.595
then they are maybe in simulation.

53
00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:17.622
And you know which parts you will
have to retest on the road, or

54
00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:22.128
which parts you will have to test
on closed-circuit, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:22.664
>> Fascinating.

56
00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:32.664
