1
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.410
I see that the long-term benefits for

2
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.290
autonomous driving
is first off safety.

3
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.270
I hear of people who've been

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.330
driving late at night
and find that they've

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140
seen crashes or you drive
home and everything's

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.810
congested because someone maybe
fell asleep at the wheel,

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.410
or they just bumped
the person in front of

8
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.085
them and if we can get to

9
00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:38.285
a point a society

10
00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:42.065
with autonomous vehicles as
every vehicle out there,

11
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:44.040
we shouldn't have anymore crashes.

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340
We should be able to
drive from point A

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.310
to point B and be very safe about it,

14
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.680
and on top of that,

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.330
hopefully congestion goes down.

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.825
You should have less people
on the road because you

17
00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.940
have these cars that
they'll talk to each

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.459
other and everyone's
driving the same speed,

19
00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.980
because there's no switching lanes

20
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.040
constantly to get the faster lane,

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.320
which is what causes congestion a

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.350
lot on top of construction
and everything else.

23
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
On top of that, it also adds mobility

24
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.560
for people who maybe
can't drive themselves.

25
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.260
Maybe they aren't able to get
a license or in our city,

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.485
it's just not practical to own a car.

27
00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:26.225
It makes way more sense
to take the bus

28
00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:28.880
or an autonomous vehicle
at some point,

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.310
where you can get to point A to
point B without having to go

30
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.130
the random route which a bus
would have to take you.

31
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.385
So even before our code gets
deployed onto the vehicle,

32
00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.580
we go through multiple stages
of checking and making

33
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.030
sure that it's functioning
in the way that we expect.

34
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.640
So for example, we
rerun it in simulation,

35
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.955
we run it against education
set we've seen before,

36
00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:54.500
and finally when we deploy
it on the vehicles,

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.060
we run it on our private test tracks

38
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.225
before we take it
out into the public.

39
00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:01.430
To ensure the safety of the vehicles
that we have on the road,

40
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.490
we have multiple stages of
testing that we go through before

41
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.490
we actually deploy these software
features on the vehicle.

42
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.560
So, we test our code rigorously,

43
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.850
the first in simulation and

44
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.480
then against edge cases that
we might have seen before.

45
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
Then once we actually deploy
the code onto the vehicles,

46
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.040
we test these vehicles on

47
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.150
our private test tracks before we
take them out onto public roads.

48
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.510
One of the main advantages of
having an autonomous vehicles is

49
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.990
that there is safety, right.

50
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.420
So, the statistic that
gets thrown around quite

51
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.760
a bit is that 94 percent of crashes

52
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.040
are caused by human error and that's

53
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.635
a huge margin for improvement that
autonomous vehicles offers us.

54
00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.490
Guaranteeing safety across all of

55
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.460
the different scenarios open to

56
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.805
us on the road is definitely
one of the major challenges.

57
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:59.510
But fortunately, we have ways of
figuring that out whether it's

58
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.390
through simulation or
miles accumulation

59
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.895
through real-world testing
and computer testing.

60
00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.270
This topic often comes up in that,

61
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.100
obviously there's
different feasibility

62
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.105
between daytime and nighttime.

63
00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:14.000
Fortunately, we have a variety of

64
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.570
sensor modality modes that
really well augment each other.

65
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.050
For example, radar and lidar can
see perfectly well at night.

66
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.000
So, we have through the use of

67
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.980
multiple different
sensor technologies,

68
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.120
being able to create

69
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.290
a safe comprehensive perception

70
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.690
of our world around
us even at nighttime.

71
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.630
We definitely take testing
and safety very seriously.

72
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.790
A live testing start cell in
computer simulation for example,

73
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.120
to make sure that everything is up to

74
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.450
par and the live real-world
testing starts out with

75
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.600
human drivers at the wheel
who are able to take over at

76
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.415
any time to guarantee the safety
if anything were to go wrong.

77
00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.810
Going forward, we do this and

78
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.170
more and more as we accumulate
more miles more experience,

79
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.870
we learn more and more
from the datasets

80
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.540
that we collect to further
refine our systems.

81
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.570
Many of us would have
known family members or

82
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.660
people who've had an accident
whilst driving a car.

83
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.189
That's a bad thing but
after that accident,

84
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.800
your neighbor doesn't
necessarily get a better driver.

85
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.560
Doesn't become a better driver.

86
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.950
But with driverless cars
in 20 years time,

87
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.955
I'll be able to get into driverless
cars that have the benefit of

88
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:29.280
all the miles the other
driverless cars have ever driven,

89
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.930
and we exactly don't
have that with humans.

90
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.990
So, it's a really
compelling argument for

91
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
these machines to share
their data as well and to share

92
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.730
their experience of driving in

93
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.520
every way that as humans
we don't do it as

94
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.770
a lonely experience
that we have all of

95
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.340
our 18-year-old repeat and
starting is no great drivers.

96
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.150
So that's insane. So, there's
so many reasons why we want to fix

97
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.100
transports in cities
and when you're in

98
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.500
a plane and you look
down out of a window,

99
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.140
look how much of the infrastructure
that we have built on

100
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.870
our nations is because
we want to move stuff.
